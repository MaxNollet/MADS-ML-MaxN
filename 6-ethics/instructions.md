# Assignment 2

The casestudy is about a (Dutch) dating app. This app matches users via an algoritm that picks out a likely match and sends them on a date. The problem was that there was a suspicion that the algoritm was biased and the possibility of discrimination existed.

More on this casestudy in the following link (it is in Dutch):

Your portfolio assignment is the following 1. Read the dating casus. 2. Formulate your first impression on the ethical issues and how they came about. 3. Draw a DAG (or multiple DAGs) for this dilemma. 4. After this exercise (nr.3), are there aspects that you missed in your first impression? 5. What recommendation would you give to a data scientist who gets an assignment like this?

Keep it succinct (max 600 words main body text).

Use APA to refer to your sources.
