    "text": "1.1.1 Report\n\n1.1.1.1 Experiment\nExperiment with things like: - change the number of epochs, eg to 5 or 10. - changing the amount of units1 and units2 to values between 16 and 1024. Use factors of 2 to easily scan the ranges: 16, 32, 64, etc. - changing the batchsize to values between 4 and 128. Again, use factors of two for convenience. - change the depth of your model by adding a additional linear layer + activation function - changing the learningrate to values between 1e-2 and 1e-5 - changing the optimizer from SGD to one of the other available algoritms at torch (scroll down for the algorithms)\nCheck the results: - all your experiments are saved in the modellogs directory, with a timestamp. Inside you find a model.toml file, that contains all the settings of the model. The events file is what tensorboard will show. - visualize the relationship between variables: for example, make a heatmap of units vs layers.\nStudyquestions: - Epochs: what is the upside, what is the downside of increasing epochs? Do you need more epochs to find out which configuration is best? When do you need that, when not? - what is an upside of using factors of 2 for hypertuning? What is a downside?\n\n\n1.1.1.2 Note\nA note on train_steps: this is a setting that determines how often you get an update. Because our complete dataset is 938 (60000 / 64) batches long, you will need 938 trainstep to cover the complete 60.000 images.\nThis can actually be a bit confusion for some students, because changing the value of trainsteps 938 changes the meaning of an epoch slightly, because one epoch is no longer the full dataset, but simply trainstep batches. Setting trainsteps to 100 means you need to wait twice as long before you get feedback on the performance, as compared to trainsteps=50. You will see that settings trainsteps to 100 improves the learning, but that is simply because the model has seen twice as much examples as compared to trainsteps=50.\nThis implies that it is not usefull to compare trainsteps=50 and trainsteps=100, because setting it to 100 will always be better. Just pick an amount that works for your hardware & patience, and adjust your number of epochs accordingly (increase epochs with lower values for trainsteps)\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Reflect\nDoing a master means you don’t just start engineering a pipeline, but you need to reflect. Why do you see the results you see? What does this mean, considering the theory? Write down lessons learned and reflections, based on experimental results. This is the science part of data science.\nYou follow this cycle: - make a hypothesis - design an experiment - run the experiment - analyze the results and draw conclusions - repeat\n\n1.1.2.1 Tip\nTo keep track of this process, it is useful to keep a journal. While you could use anything to do so, a nice command line tool is jrnl. This gives you the advantage of staying in the terminal, just type down your ideas during the process, and you can always look back at what you have done. Try to first formulate a hypothesis, and then design an experiment to test it. This will help you to stay focused on the goal, and not get lost in the data.\nImportant: the report you write is NOT the same as your journal! The journal will help you to keep track of your process, and later write down a reflection on what you have done where you draw conclusion, reflecting back on the theory.\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Make a short report\nMake a short report of your findings. pay attention to: - what was your hypothesis about interaction between hyperparameters? - what did you find? - visualise your results about the relationship between hyperparameters.",

    "text": "2.1 Model comparison\nEthical models share the common goal of providing readers with a systematic approach to ethical decision making,yet include unique elements that provide varying contextual recommendations (Suarez et al., 2023). Some models offer a generalisable approach affording wider applicability to a variety of ethical situations, and other models provide guidance to navigate specific ethical situations.\nA recent literature review from 2023 considered a total of 55 ethical decision-making models across 60 peer-reviewed journal articles of varying fields of study (Suarez et al., 2023). Medicine dominated the resulting set of models, followed by psychology, education, business, then child and youth care and organizational behaviour management. From these fields of study, two models are considered for comparison. The first model is from the medicine, to be more precise: epidemiology (Soskolne, 1991) and the second model from the secondary field of teaching within education (Ehrich et al., 2011). The steps of both models are displayed in Table 2.1.",

In epidemiology this is based on data, while in teaching this is based on agency requirements and dispositional factors. This assessment forms the basis for the problem or dilemma identification. Also, both models require identification of alternatives and making a choice or judgement based on the best alternative. Al last, both models are sequential.\n\n\n2.1.2 Differences\nThe epidemiology model has a problem-solving component, while the teaching model does not. A problem-solving component is present if the model author(s) guided the model users to identify two or more possible solutions and likely outcomes or consequences to the possible solutions. The epidemiology model encourages users to identify multiple solutions and evaluate them after making a decision, while the teaching model only encourages identification of multiple solutions. Another difference is that the epidemiology model indicates that a decision can be changed later when a solution is not good enough after evaluation, while the teaching model does not.\n\n\n2.1.3 Preference & suitability\nPersonally I prefer the epidemiology ethical model as it allows changing the decision if it turns out that is is not the optimal decision after evaluation. This is also better suited for data science. Suppose some actions are taken prevent a data science model from discrimination but in practice it does not work, this ethical model allows us to change our decision and take different actions for preventing discrimination. For the teaching ethical model, once a decision is made, it set sort of ‘set in stone’.\nThe epidemiology ethical model is also better suited for data science as it focusses on data for the problem identification and alternative actions.",

    "text": "2.2 Breeze matching\nThis assignment is about a discriminating matchmaking algorithm of the Dutch dating app Breeze (Dating-app Breeze mag (en moet) algoritme aanpassen om discriminatie te voorkomen | College voor de Rechten van de Mens, 2023). This matchmaking algorithm calculates a so-called matching chance: an indication of how likely one person may like the other person. Matchmaking happens automatically and is learnt from data that people put into their Breeze profiles and the like-behaviour (users of the Breeze app that indicate whether they like someone or not).\nThe developers of the app, Breeze Social B.V., got the suspicion that their algorithm was discriminating as some customers made complaints. They indicated that people suggested by the algorithm were not diverse enough, leading to people with a dark skin colour or non-Dutch background to stop using the app.\nBreeze Social B.V. asked the Netherlands Institute for Human Rights whether they are allowed to adjust their algorithm to stop it from discriminating. I think that they made the right choice to at least questioning whether their algorithm was ethically sound. This shows a sense of ownership and responsibility regarding their algorithm. The institute indicated that Breeze Social B.V. are allowed and, in fact, must adjust the algorithm to stop it from discriminating. The first suggested adjustment was to raise the matching chance of people with a certain skin colour but was rejected by the institute. As the article points out, this leads to the opposite: the algorithm still discriminates but now favours some people with a certain skin colour. This is not ideal in my opinion as some people get some sort of priority treatment this way. The second suggested adjustment was better: compensate the matching score to be equally high for all skin colours. Now there is no discrimination happening and everyone is at least equally often suggested to other people.\n\n2.2.1 Dilemma visualisation\nThe dilemma described above is visualised as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in Figure 2.1. There are 3 distinct components: 1) stakeholders, 2) choices and 3) consequences. Choices are for Breeze Social B.V. and the results are focussed towards the users of Breeze, how a choice would affect a group of users.\nAfter making this diagram I realised that the motivation for changing the matchmaking algorithm is not really made clear. The article mentioned customer complaints, but is that the real motivation? Breeze Social B.V. is a company that needs money to continue existing and they get that from their users, as one needs to pay upfront for a date (after a match was made). Is it goodwill to please their customers or is it really more about maximising their income? In either case, both parties would benefit if the algorithm would not discriminate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: A directed acyclic graph (DAG) visualisation of the discriminating Breeze matchmaking algorithm dilemma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDating-app Breeze mag (en moet) algoritme aanpassen om discriminatie te voorkomen | College voor de Rechten van de Mens.
