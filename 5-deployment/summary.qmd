# Deployment

This is the deployment of a street language generator, using Docker. The generator was trained on [Helmonds dialect](https://www.mijnwoordenboek.nl/dialect/Helmonds){.external target="_blank"} in a fully automated fashion using a Makefile. The street language generator is available on [https://slanggen.mxlab.nl/](https://slanggen.mxlab.nl/){.external target="_blank"}. For reference, a screenshot of the generator can be found in @fig-street-language-generator.

## Note: start the VM

The street language generator is hosted on a SURF Research Cloud virtual machine (VM). You might need to start the VM, as it is paused by default to conserve credits. To start the VM, do the following:

1.  Open the [SURF Research Cloud dashboard](https://sram.surf.nl/collaborations/6111/about){.external target="_blank"}.
2.  Search for `UOS3-MJHNollet`.
3.  Click on `Resume ▶️`.
4.  Wait for the VM to resume.

The street language generator is available as a Docker image on <https://github.com/MaxNollet/MADS-ML-MaxN/pkgs/container/slanggen>{.external target="_blank"}. Below is an example Docker compose to run the model:

``` yml
